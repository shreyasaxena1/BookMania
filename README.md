#### Personal Notes 

For Dashboard Fragment :: Set as Default Fragment

It has list of books for which i have used RecyclerView ( Preferred over ListView ) </br>
   Component of Recycler View </br>
   -> LayoutManager : How items are displayed </br>
   -> ViewHolder : View--single for all the list items as each list item has same view and also list items are dynamic size so we cannot predefine its number </br>
   -> Adapter : Binds view with data </br>
   
   Dashboard Fragment file and recycler_dashboard_simgle_row file
   (Too confusing rn)
    -- can refer comments in the code for more information
